        <h1><em><b>Shin Chan</b></em></h1>
        <p><em>In Kasukabe town where mischief thrives,
            Lives a boy named Shin Chan, full of jives.
            With his cheeky grin and a twinkle in his eye,
            He'll make you laugh until you cry.
            
            He teases his sister, Himawari, so sweet,
            And drives his mom, Misae, off her feet.  
            His antics with friends are always a blast,
            In every adventure, he's unsurpassed.
            
            From playing pranks to chasing dreams,
            Shin Chan's world is never what it seems.
            So here's to the boy with a heart so fine,
            Forever our favorite troublemaker, Shin Chan, divine!
